 <h4>Background: This system was created in response to the current Covid-19 crisis, and it allows users to purchase an aircraft ticket online by selecting the location, date, and kind of travel. They must submit the vaccination details for the safety requirement throughout the booking procedure. The passenger can get both the receipt and the whole payment for their flight. They can also verify their ticket record in the system's database "My Ticket". The GUI is developed with the function need in mind rather than the design..</h4>
